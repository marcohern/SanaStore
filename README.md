# SanaStore
SanaStore is a single-page application, built as a Demo for Sana.
## Features
SanaStore is built with:

- [ASP.NET Core (MVC/WebAPI)](https://get.asp.net/) and [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx) for cross-platform server-side code
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) for client-side code
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for building and bundling client-side resources
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for layout and styling

To help you get started, we've also set up:

- **Client-side navigation**. For example, click Counter then Back to return here.
- **Server-side prerendering**. For faster initial loading and improved SEO, your Angular app is prerendered on the server. The resulting HTML is then transferred to the browser where a client-side copy of the app takes over.
- **Webpack dev middleware**. In development mode, there's no need to run the webpack build tool. Your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand. Updates are available as soon as you modify any file.
- **Hot module replacement**. In development mode, you don't even need to reload the page after making most changes. Within seconds of saving changes to files, your Angular app will be rebuilt and a new instance injected into the page.
- **Efficient production builds**. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and the webpack build tool produces minified static CSS and JavaScript files.
